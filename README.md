  <li>Practice using common JS methods such as map(), filter(), and reduce()</li>
  <li>Mobile first design</li>
  <li>Flexbox and Grid</li>
</ul>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>This project was mainly a way to practice using React. I feel like I learned a lot, like how to manipulate state, pass data between components and navegate those components. I am a lot more confident in my React skills after doing this project. And I enjoyed getting to make a ukulele-based website (I'm an avid uke player :musical_note:). I also enjoyed the process of designing mobile-first. It looks great on mobile and it was relatively easy to make it look good on a desktop. And I love getting to *pun fully intended* <i>flex</i> my flexbox skills, and my grid skills. Both have been immensely helpful when making layouts and alligning elements. I'd like to add on to it later maybe with a backend and user authentication. Overall though, I learned a lot, it was a fun project, and I like how it turned out :smiley:  </p>
